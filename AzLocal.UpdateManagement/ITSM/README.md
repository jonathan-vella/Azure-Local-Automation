# ITSM Connector for AzLocal.UpdateManagement

> Optional feature. Disabled by default. Module: `AzLocal.UpdateManagement` v0.7.4+ (Phase 1 shipped in v0.7.4; current module is v0.7.70).
> Phase 1 (this release): ServiceNow incident creation + dedupe + connection probe. Phase 2 (Sync close-out via `Sync-AzLocalIncident`) and Phase 3 (Teams / Slack mirror adapters) are **deferred** to a future release - the design lives in [`ITSM-Connector-Plan.md`](./ITSM-Connector-Plan.md) but the functions are not yet shipped.

This folder is the setup-and-configure landing page for the ITSM Connector. It walks an operator through every step from "nothing wired" to "the apply-updates pipeline opens a deduped ServiceNow incident when a cluster needs human intervention".

The connector is **fully opt-in**: existing pipelines that do not set `raise_itsm_ticket=true` are unchanged.

| File | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `README.md` | This page - setup walkthrough and quick start. |
| [ITSM-Config-Reference.md](./ITSM-Config-Reference.md) | Full schema reference for the YAML/JSON config (every field, every default). |
| [ITSM-Connector-Plan.md](./ITSM-Connector-Plan.md) | Design + decisions log (architecture, trigger matrix, severity mapping, security model). |

A working sample config plus the Mustache ticket-body template live at [`../Automation-Pipeline-Examples/.itsm/`](../Automation-Pipeline-Examples/.itsm/).

## 1. What this connector does

When any of the three "operator-attention" pipelines finishes - **`Step.5_apply-updates`**, **`Step.6_fleet-update-status`** (unresolved Failed update runs), and **`Step.7_fleet-health-status`** (Critical / Warning fleet-health failures) - the connector reads the JUnit results file the module already emits and, for each cluster row whose `Status` is in your trigger matrix:

1. Computes a deterministic dedupe key (SHA256 of `ClusterResourceId | UpdateName | TriggerCategory`).
2. Asks ServiceNow whether an incident with that key already exists in state New / In Progress / On Hold.
3. If yes -> returns `Action='DedupedToExisting'` (no new ticket).
4. If no -> creates a new incident with the trigger's severity, category, and the five `u_azlocal_*` custom fields populated.

> **v0.7.70: Step.6 and Step.7 now raise tickets too (Phase D).** Until v0.7.69 only `Step.5_apply-updates` auto-called `New-AzLocalIncident`. In v0.7.70 the same opt-in wiring is present in both `Step.6_fleet-update-status` (sources from the `Update Run History and Error Details` testsuite produced by `Get-AzLocalUpdateRunFailures -State Failed -OnlyUnresolved`) and `Step.7_fleet-health-status` (sources from the `Fleet Health Failures` testsuite produced by `Get-AzLocalFleetHealthFailures -View Detail`, sorted Critical-first). Both new wirings are **gated** by a `raise_itsm_ticket` workflow input (default `false`) and an `itsm_dry_run` input - so existing runs that do not toggle them on are byte-identical to v0.7.69. The `itsm-secrets` block is wrapped in `BEGIN-AZLOCAL-CUSTOMIZE:itsm-secrets` / `END-AZLOCAL-CUSTOMIZE:itsm-secrets` markers so operator-side secret bindings survive a `Update-AzLocalPipelineExample` upgrade. The JUnit files Step.6/Step.7 emit carry the v0.7.70 hyperlinked deep-link columns (`UpdateRunPortalUrl`, `ClusterPortalUrl`, `CurrentStep`, `Duration`, `DeepestErrMsg`, `Severity`, `TargetResourceName`, `TargetResourceType`, `HealthResultsAgeDays`) so the ticket title + body can deep-link straight into the Azure portal blade for the affected cluster / update run.

What it deliberately does **not** do in Phase 1: open Jira / ADO Work Items, send Teams / Slack notifications, or close tickets on success. See [ITSM-Connector-Plan.md Sections 2 + 9](./ITSM-Connector-Plan.md) for the phased roadmap.

## 2. Prerequisites

| Requirement | Notes |
|---|---|
| PowerShell 5.1+ | Same as the rest of the module. |
| `Az.Accounts` + `Az.KeyVault` modules | Only when `secrets.source: keyvault` (recommended). `Az.KeyVault` is checked at runtime - install with `Install-Module Az.KeyVault -Scope CurrentUser` if not present. |
| `powershell-yaml` module | Only when the config file is `.yml` / `.yaml`. JSON config works on stock PowerShell. Install with `Install-Module powershell-yaml -Scope CurrentUser`. |
| An Azure Key Vault | Recommended for storing the ServiceNow OAuth client_secret. CI-native secrets (`env://NAME`) are supported as a fallback for users with no Key Vault access. |
| ServiceNow instance | Any supported release. You will register one OAuth application + import one Update Set (see Section 3). |

---

## 3. ServiceNow one-time setup

You need three things in ServiceNow: an OAuth app, five custom fields on the `incident` table, and an assignment group.

### 3.1 Register an OAuth application registry

1. In ServiceNow, navigate to **System OAuth -> Application Registry**.
2. **New -> Create an OAuth API endpoint for external clients**.
3. Name: `AzLocal Update Management`. **Save**.
4. Copy the generated **Client ID** and **Client Secret** - both go into Key Vault in Section 4.
5. Note your instance URL (e.g. `https://yourco.service-now.com`).

#### 3.1.5 Service account and roles for the OAuth client

The OAuth `client_credentials` grant ServiceNow issues is tied to a **ServiceNow user account** (commonly called the *technical user* or *integration user*). The token the connector receives carries that user's roles, and ServiceNow Table API authorisation is evaluated against those roles - not against the OAuth app itself. Misconfigure this and step 4 of the connection probe (Section 6) fails with HTTP 403 even though OAuth succeeded.

Recommended setup:

1. Create a dedicated user (e.g. `svc.azlocal.itsm`) in **User Administration -> Users**. Mark it **Web service access only** and **Internal Integration User** if your release supports those flags.
2. Open the **Application Registry** record from Section 3.1 and set **OAuth Provider Profile -> Run as user** to the new account. (On releases where Application Registries do not expose this directly, set the user inside the linked **OAuth Entity Profile**.)
3. Grant the user **`itil`** role (read + write on `incident`) AND a role that can read the table the connection probe issues a one-row read against (`itil` is sufficient). Do NOT grant `admin`.
4. If you also want the connector to read existing incidents created by humans (for dedupe), make sure those incidents are not restricted by an ACL the `itil` role cannot satisfy.

Nothing in the connector requires elevated privileges. Keep the role footprint to `itil`.

### 3.2 Add the five custom fields on the `incident` table

The connector writes five custom fields to every incident it creates so future runs can find them. The original plan shipped an Update Set XML for this; in v0.7.4 it is a **manual procedure** (Update Set XML is deferred to a follow-up release). All five fields go on the `incident` table:

| Field name | Type | Max length | Default | Indexed | Why |
|---|---|---:|---|---|---|
| `u_azlocal_dedupe_key` | String | 64 | (empty) | **Yes - required** | SHA256 hex used by `FindByDedupe`. Without an index, every dedupe lookup performs a full table scan and breaks on large instances. |
| `u_azlocal_cluster_resource_id` | String | 512 | (empty) | No | Full Azure resource ID of the cluster - operators use this to jump to Portal. |
| `u_azlocal_update_name` | String | 64 | (empty) | No | The HCI update name (e.g. `2511.0.10.0`). |
| `u_azlocal_run_id` | String | 128 | (empty) | No | Workflow / pipeline run ID - links back to the originating CI run. |
| `u_azlocal_source` | String | 64 | `AzLocal.UpdateManagement` | No | Discriminator; lets `Sync-AzLocalIncident` (Phase 2) filter to tickets it owns. |

Procedure:

1. Sign in to ServiceNow as a user with `admin`.
2. Navigate to **System Definition -> Tables**, search for `incident`, open it.
3. In the **Columns** related list, **New** and create each row from the table above. Pick **Type: String**, set **Max length**, and set **Column name** to the value in the table (ServiceNow auto-prefixes `u_`, so type `azlocal_dedupe_key` - the `u_` shown here is the rendered column name).
4. For `u_azlocal_dedupe_key`, after saving open the column and tick **Create Index** (or **Add Index** on older releases). **This is required** - the dedupe query is `incident?sysparm_query=u_azlocal_dedupe_key=<hash>^state!=6^state!=7`, and at typical fleet sizes (low thousands of clusters) it must be index-served.
5. For `u_azlocal_source`, set **Default value** to `AzLocal.UpdateManagement` so manual record creation (if it ever happens) still tags correctly.
6. Optional: add the five new columns to the default incident form view via **Configure -> Form Layout** so operators see them when looking at a ticket.

When an Update Set XML ships in a later release, importing it will be idempotent: the manual fields you create now will be reused.

### 3.3 Create an assignment group

`AzureLocal-Ops` (or whatever you set in `defaults.assignmentGroup`). New tickets are routed here so existing on-call rotations work unchanged.

---

## 4. Pick a secret source

The connector reads three secrets at run time: `clientId`, `clientSecret`, and (cosmetically) `instanceUrl`. Two supported sources:

### 4.1 Azure Key Vault (recommended)

```yaml
secrets:
  source: keyvault
  keyvaultName: corp-prod-kv-01
  servicenow:
    clientId:     sn-azlocal-clientid       # bare name resolved in corp-prod-kv-01
    clientSecret: sn-azlocal-clientsecret
    instanceUrl:  env://ITSM_SN_INSTANCE_URL # never a secret, kept here for parity
```

Grant the pipeline service principal **Key Vault Secrets User** on the vault scope:

```powershell
az role assignment create \
    --role "Key Vault Secrets User" \
    --assignee "<sp-object-id>" \
    --scope   "/subscriptions/<sub>/resourceGroups/<rg>/providers/Microsoft.KeyVault/vaults/corp-prod-kv-01"
```

No extra Azure Key Vault access policies are needed beyond this RBAC. The connector reuses the **same** Az session the rest of the module uses, so no extra service principal management.

### 4.2 CI-native secrets (fallback for users without Key Vault)

```yaml
secrets:
  source: envvar
  servicenow:
    clientId:     env://ITSM_SN_CLIENT_ID
    clientSecret: env://ITSM_SN_CLIENT_SECRET
    instanceUrl:  env://ITSM_SN_INSTANCE_URL
```

Then in your pipeline YAML, surface the GitHub / Azure DevOps secrets as environment variables on the ITSM step. See [`../Automation-Pipeline-Examples/`](../Automation-Pipeline-Examples/) for working YAML.

> **Never put a raw secret in the config file.** The only literal-value form is `literal://<value>` and it is rejected unless the caller passes `-AllowLiteral` (used internally for `instanceUrl`, which is not a secret).

> **Secret memory residency:** once `Resolve-AzLocalItsmSecret` reads a value out of Key Vault or an environment variable it materialises that value as a normal `[string]` inside the PowerShell session for the duration of the OAuth `client_credentials` token grant and the subsequent ServiceNow table calls. The connector does not load these values into `[SecureString]`, because the ServiceNow REST and OAuth surfaces require a plaintext POST body. This is comparable to the way most CI/CD secrets are handled at run time, but worth knowing: the secret will be reachable to anything that has process-memory access to the pipeline runner. Mitigations baked into the module are (1) the secret is never echoed - all log/error/throw paths route through `ConvertTo-ScrubbedCliOutput`; (2) URIs are redacted via the `(client_secret|access_token|password)=[^&]+ -> $1=***` rule before being logged; (3) the temp body files used by `az rest` PATCH callers are deleted in `finally` blocks. Keep your runner host trusted, rotate ServiceNow OAuth client secrets, and prefer Key Vault over env-vars wherever the runner supports it.

---

## 5. Author the trigger matrix

Drop a file at `./.itsm/azurelocal-itsm.yml` in the consumer repo. The full schema is in [`ITSM-Config-Reference.md`](./ITSM-Config-Reference.md). A minimum-viable matrix is:

```yaml
schemaVersion: 1
secrets:
  source: keyvault
  keyvaultName: corp-prod-kv-01
  servicenow:
    clientId:     sn-azlocal-clientid
    clientSecret: sn-azlocal-clientsecret
    instanceUrl:  env://ITSM_SN_INSTANCE_URL
defaults:
  itsmTarget: ServiceNow
  assignmentGroup: AzureLocal-Ops
triggers:
  Failed:             { raiseTicket: true,  severity: 2, category: 'Cluster update failure' }
  Error:              { raiseTicket: true,  severity: 2, category: 'Cluster update failure' }
  HealthCheckBlocked: { raiseTicket: true,  severity: 3, category: 'Pre-update health resolution' }
  SideloadedBlocked:  { raiseTicket: true,  severity: 4, category: 'Operator action: stage sideloaded payload' }
  ScheduleBlocked:    { raiseTicket: false }   # self-resolves; opt-in if desired
  Skipped:            { raiseTicket: false }
  NotReady:           { raiseTicket: false }
  # --- v0.7.70 Phase D: Step.7 fleet-health-failure statuses ---
  # Get-AzLocalFleetHealthFailures emits Severity = Critical / Warning / Information.
  # Critical-first sort means the highest-impact rows are processed first.
  Critical:           { raiseTicket: true,  severity: 1, category: 'Cluster health: critical failure' }
  Warning:            { raiseTicket: true,  severity: 3, category: 'Cluster health: warning' }
  Information:        { raiseTicket: false }
```

A ready-to-copy version with comments lives at [`../Automation-Pipeline-Examples/.itsm/azurelocal-itsm.yml`](../Automation-Pipeline-Examples/.itsm/azurelocal-itsm.yml).

## 6. Validate before you wire it into a pipeline

Run these two probes from any host that has the module + an Az session pointed at the same tenant the pipeline will use:

```powershell
Import-Module ./AzLocal.UpdateManagement.psd1 -Force
$cfg = Get-AzLocalItsmConfig -Path ./.itsm/azurelocal-itsm.yml
$cfg.SchemaVersion              # -> 1
$cfg.Triggers['Failed']         # -> normalised hashtable

Test-AzLocalItsmConnection -Config $cfg | Format-Table Step, Pass, Message
# Expected output: 4 rows all Pass=True
#   Resolve instanceUrl   True   https://yourco.service-now.com
#   Resolve OAuth secrets True   clientId + clientSecret resolved.
#   OAuth token grant     True   expires_in=1800s
#   Incident table read   True   GET incident?sysparm_limit=1 succeeded.
```

If any step shows `Pass=False`, fix that step before enabling the pipeline.

#### What a failure looks like

A typical first-time-setup failure surfaces as:

```
Step                  Pass  Message
----                  ----  -------
Resolve instanceUrl   True  https://yourco.service-now.com
Resolve OAuth secrets True  clientId + clientSecret resolved.
OAuth token grant     True  expires_in=1800s
Incident table read   False HTTP 403 Forbidden - GET /api/now/table/incident?sysparm_limit=1. Body: { "error": { "message": "User Not Authorized", "detail": "..." } }
```

The first three rows passing tells you OAuth and the secret pipeline work. The fourth-row 403 always means the ServiceNow user backing the OAuth client (Section 3.1.5) is missing the `itil` role. Fix the role, re-run the probe.

Other shapes worth recognising:

- **HTTP 401** on step 4 (token issued, then immediately rejected on the read) almost always means the OAuth Entity Profile is wired to a disabled user. Re-enable the user, regenerate the secret if you suspect rotation.
- **HTTP 200 but no body fields** is harmless - the probe only asserts a 2xx + a JSON envelope; field-presence checks are deferred to a follow-up phase.
- **Operation timed out** at step 3 with a `.service-now.com` URL usually means a proxy in the agent's outbound path is intercepting OAuth. Open the proxy or pin the agent to a route that hits ServiceNow directly.

---

## 7. Dry run against a real JUnit file

Once `Test-AzLocalItsmConnection` is all-green, run `New-AzLocalIncident` in `-DryRun` mode to see what would be ticketed without making any HTTP writes:

```powershell
$cfg = Get-AzLocalItsmConfig -Path ./.itsm/azurelocal-itsm.yml

New-AzLocalIncident `
    -InputArtifactPath ./artifacts/update-results.xml `
    -Config            $cfg `
    -RunMetadata       @{ Platform='manual'; RunId='dryrun-001'; RunUrl='n/a' } `
    -DryRun `
    -ExportPath        ./artifacts/itsm-dryrun.csv |
  Format-Table ClusterName, Status, Action, Severity, DedupeKey -AutoSize
```

`Action` will be one of: `Skipped` (status not raised by matrix), `DryRun` (would have created), `DedupedToExisting` (existing open incident found - DryRun still queries because Phase 1 dedupe is read-only), or `Created` / `CreateFailed` (only outside DryRun).

> **WhatIf vs DryRun**: `-DryRun` skips ALL HTTP writes. `-WhatIf` (PowerShell-native, via `SupportsShouldProcess`) still authenticates and de-duplicates - it only blocks the final `POST /incident` write.

---

## 8. Wire into the pipeline

The example pipelines under [`../Automation-Pipeline-Examples/`](../Automation-Pipeline-Examples/) ship the wired step in **three** places as of v0.7.70:

| Pipeline | Trigger source | JUnit input | Default behaviour |
|---|---|---|---|
| `Step.5_apply-updates` | `Get-AzLocalUpdateRunFailures` (live, from the run that just executed) | `./reports/update-results.xml` | Wired since v0.7.4 |
| `Step.6_fleet-update-status` | `Get-AzLocalUpdateRunFailures -State Failed -OnlyUnresolved` (fleet, last 30 days) | `./reports/fleet-update-status.xml` | **v0.7.70 Phase D**, default OFF |
| `Step.7_fleet-health-status` | `Get-AzLocalFleetHealthFailures -View Detail` (Critical-first) | `./reports/fleet-health-status.xml` | **v0.7.70 Phase D**, default OFF |

All three are gated on `raise_itsm_ticket` (a `workflow_dispatch` choice / pipeline parameter, default `false`) and fully opt-in - existing runs that do not toggle it on are byte-identical to before. The Step.6 / Step.7 wirings also expose an `itsm_dry_run` input (and Step.7 an `itsm_force_create`) so operators can preview tickets before flipping the switch.

Key points from the wired step (full YAML in the example files):

```yaml
- name: Raise ITSM tickets
  if: ${{ github.event.inputs.raise_itsm_ticket == 'true' }}
  shell: pwsh
  env:
    # BEGIN-AZLOCAL-CUSTOMIZE:itsm-secrets
    ITSM_SN_INSTANCE_URL:  ${{ secrets.ITSM_SN_INSTANCE_URL }}
    ITSM_SN_CLIENT_ID:     ${{ secrets.ITSM_SN_CLIENT_ID }}
    ITSM_SN_CLIENT_SECRET: ${{ secrets.ITSM_SN_CLIENT_SECRET }}
    # END-AZLOCAL-CUSTOMIZE:itsm-secrets
  run: |
    Import-Module ${{ env.MODULE_PATH }}/AzLocal.UpdateManagement.psd1 -Force
    $cfg = Get-AzLocalItsmConfig -Path "${{ github.event.inputs.itsm_config_path }}"
    New-AzLocalIncident `
        -InputArtifactPath ./reports/fleet-health-status.xml `
        -Config $cfg `
        -RunMetadata @{
            Platform = 'github'
            RunId    = $env:GITHUB_RUN_ID
            RunUrl   = "$env:GITHUB_SERVER_URL/$env:GITHUB_REPOSITORY/actions/runs/$env:GITHUB_RUN_ID"
        } `
        -DryRun:([bool]::Parse($env:INPUT_ITSM_DRY_RUN)) `
        -ExportPath      ./reports/itsm-results.csv `
        -ExportJUnitPath ./reports/itsm-results.xml
```

- **Secrets are mapped via `env:`** on the step, not passed on the PowerShell command line. The module picks them up via `env://NAME` references in the config file. This keeps secret values off process listings, off the rendered step inputs, and out of CI logs.
- **`BEGIN-AZLOCAL-CUSTOMIZE:itsm-secrets` / `END-AZLOCAL-CUSTOMIZE:itsm-secrets` markers** wrap the secret bindings. `Update-AzLocalPipelineExample` preserves everything inside those markers across module upgrades, so operator-side secret remapping survives a `Update-AzLocalPipelineExample` run.
- The step writes **two** artefacts (`itsm-results.csv` for humans, `itsm-results.xml` for `dorny/test-reporter` / `PublishTestResults@2`). Both upload happens unconditionally if the step ran, including in `-DryRun`, so an audit trail exists either way. The ADO Publish task uses `azlocal-fleet-*-itsm-results_$(stamp.artifactStamp)` to match the v0.7.66 timestamped-artifact convention.
- The Azure DevOps mirror is the same shape with `AzureCLI@2` + a `- group: AzureLocal-ITSM-Secrets` variable group (kept commented out by default so the example file loads cleanly for users who have not yet wired the variable group).

The first production run should keep `raise_itsm_ticket=false` (or set `itsm_dry_run=true`) and inspect the CSV / JUnit artefact before flipping the switch.

## 9. Troubleshooting

| Symptom | Likely cause | Fix |
|---|---|---|
| `Test-AzLocalItsmConnection` step 1 fails with `not a recognised form` | A secret reference is malformed. | Confirm `kv://<vault>/<secret>` / `env://<NAME>` / bare-name format. Bare names need `secrets.source: keyvault` + `keyvaultName`. |
| Step 1 succeeds, step 2 fails with `Failed to read Key Vault secret` | Service principal lacks RBAC on the vault. | Grant `Key Vault Secrets User`. See Section 4.1. |
| Step 3 fails with `ServiceNow OAuth response did not contain an access_token` | Wrong client_id / client_secret, or the OAuth app is restricted to a different grant type. | Re-issue the secret in ServiceNow; ensure `Application Registry -> Auth Scope` allows the API endpoints used. |
| Step 4 fails with HTTP 403 | The OAuth app role is missing `web_service_admin` (read on the incident table). | Add the role to the OAuth user. |
| Connector creates a new ticket every run for the same problem | Custom field `u_azlocal_dedupe_key` not installed, so `FindByDedupe` always returns empty. | Install the custom fields (Section 3.2). |
| `Action='Skipped'` for a status you wanted to ticket | Status not in `triggers`, or `raiseTicket: false`. | Add an entry with `raiseTicket: true`. |
| `Action='CreateFailed'` with rate-limit messages | ServiceNow per-instance throttle (default 100 req/min). | The HTTP layer honours `Retry-After` automatically; if it still fails, lower the concurrent cluster count on the run or contact your SN admin. |

For deeper traces, run the step with `-Verbose`. The HTTP layer logs every attempt and retry; secret values in URLs are redacted.

---

## 10. Security model summary

- **No raw secrets ever live in config or on disk.** All secrets are read from Key Vault or environment variables at run time. The token is held in memory only.
- **The ServiceNow instance URL is not a secret**, but it identifies the tenant. The example config exposes it as `instanceUrl: env://ITSM_SN_INSTANCE_URL` so a tenant migration only needs a CI-secret rotation rather than a config-file change, and so the value is consistent with how the OAuth secrets are wired. The connector treats it as cosmetic for redaction purposes (instance hostnames are not stripped from `Verbose` logs - bearer tokens are) but never persists it.
- **Bearer tokens are redacted** in verbose logs (URL query and header values).
- **All free-text inputs** (cluster names, error text) are **HTML-escaped** when rendered into ticket descriptions to defend against ITSM-side HTML injection. Titles use plain text (no escape needed; ServiceNow `short_description` is plain text).
- **TLS 1.2+** is enforced before every HTTP call.
- **CSV-injection sanitisation** on inputs is unchanged (already present from v0.7.0).
