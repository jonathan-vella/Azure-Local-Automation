.DESCRIPTION

    AzLocal.DeploymentAutomation module for deploying Azure Local using ARM templates and parameter files using PowerShell.

    This script is used to deploy Azure Local using an ARM template deployment. It requires the following parameters:
    - SubscriptionId: The ID of the Azure subscription to use for the deployment.
    - TenantId: The ID of the Azure tenant to use for the deployment.
    - TypeOfDeployment: The type of deployment to perform (e.g., SingleNode, StorageSwitched, StorageSwitchless, RackAware).
    
    Credentials can be supplied via three methods (in priority order):
    1. Azure Key Vault: -CredentialKeyVaultName with optional -LocalAdminSecretName / -LCMAdminSecretName
    2. PSCredential parameters: -LocalAdminCredential and -LCMAdminCredential
    3. Interactive prompts: Read-Host with -AsSecureString (default fallback)

    Non-interactive deployment is supported via -UniqueID and -NetworkSettingsJson parameters.
    The function supports -WhatIf and -Confirm via SupportsShouldProcess.
    
    The script builds the following parameters:
    - UniqueID: The unique identifier for the deployment (e.g., store number, site code).
    - ClusterName: The name of the cluster to be created.
    - ResourceGroupName: The name of the resource group to be created.
    - Location: The location for the deployment (e.g., EastUS or WestEurope).
    - AzureStackLCMAdminUsername: The username for the Azure Stack LCM admin account.
    - KeyVaultName: The name of the Key Vault to be created.
    - CustomLocation: The name of the custom location to be created.
    - ResourceBridgeName: The name of the resource bridge to be created.
    - DiagnosticStorageAccountName: The name of the storage account for diagnostics.
    - StorageAccountType: The type of storage account to be created (e.g., Standard_LRS).
    - SubnetMask: The subnet mask for the deployment (e.g., 255.255.255.0).
    - NetworkSettings: The network settings for the deployment (e.g., subnet mask, default gateway, starting IP address, ending IP address, cluster IP address).
    - ParameterFilePath: The path to the parameter file for the deployment.
    - ParameterFileSettings: The settings for the parameter file.
    - Parameters: The parameters for the deployment.
    - DeploymentParameterFile: The path to the deployment-specific parameter file.
    - TemplateFilePath: The path to the template file for the deployment.

    Resource naming standards are loaded from .config/naming-standards-config.json and use the UniqueID
    placeholder to build environment-specific resource names. Edit the config file to customise
    naming conventions for your organisation.
